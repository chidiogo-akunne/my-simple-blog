# my-simple-blog
My bootcamp project is to create a blog solution that allows the blogger to create blog posts, view all list of blog post, view a specific blog post, update post and delete posts. Also people(readers) should be able to make comment on posts.
I am to develop the blog with HTML, CSS, JQuery,AJAX and JSON Server.
